The iPhone boom times may be officially over. And Apple may have the iPhone X to thank for that.

This fiscal year was supposed to be a blowout for Apple. The company redesigned its popular iPhone for the first time in three years, and touted the iPhone X as "the future" of mobile. Analysts declared it would drive a "supercycle" that would reinvigorate excitement in a sluggish smartphone market.

But it appears many people aren't quite ready for the future -- or willing to pay so much to get it.

The 5.8-inch iPhone X starts at $999, or $300 more than the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 and $200 more than the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus. For those extra hundos, you get a sharper, bigger screen in a smaller package; Face ID to unlock the device using your, well, face; and the ability to send animated emojis of yourself masquerading as a unicorn or a pile of poop.

Those changes haven't been enough to get consumers pumped, and worries remain that the mobile market will continue to fall after its first-ever year-over-year decline, in the fourth quarter of 2017. The slide underscores the industry's dilemma: It's becoming tougher for phone vendors to make huge, jaw-dropping changes to their devices, and prices for the newest flagship phones are increasing at the same time US carriers have gotten rid of subsidies. That means we're holding onto our "good enough" devices longer than before.

Not even Apple is immune.

The company will report its fiscal second-quarter results Tuesday, either alleviating or confirming fears that the iPhone's huge growth days may be behind it.
