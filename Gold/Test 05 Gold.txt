In an exclusive interview with ABC News Kyra Phillips, former deputy chief of staff Kevin Chmielewski said he was 100 percent forced out after raising concerns about Pruitts spending on first-class travel.

Chmielewski said chief of staff Ryan Jackson called him into his office and said: Hey Administrator Pruitt either wants me to fire you or put you in an office so that he doesnt have to see you again, Chmielewski told ABC News adding that And in addition to that, he wants to put Millan in your spot, as your title and your pay grade.

Chmielewski said he had previously raised concerns about things like Pruitts first-class flights and a request to spend $100,000 a month on a private jet, even meeting with the presidential personnel office about what he called lavish spending at the EPA. He said no one would look into his concerns further.

The New York Times first reported that Chmielewski and four other EPA employees were reassigned or removed from their positions for raising concerns about Pruitts spending.

Chmielewski met with members of Congress and staffers earlier this month.

The report launched queries into other Pruitt and EPA expenditures, including questions about Pruitts security spending, which far outpaced his predecessors, on things like first class flights, a 24-hour security detail, and a $43,000 soundproof phone booth for his office.
