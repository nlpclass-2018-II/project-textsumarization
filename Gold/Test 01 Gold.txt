Facing a self-imposed deadline, President Donald Trump was considering whether to permanently exempt the EU and Mexico, Canada, Australia, Argentina and Brazil from tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum that his administration imposed in March.

The EUs largest steel exporter to the U.S., it accounted for about 5 percent of U.S. steel imports last year.

The EU and others had been asked to spell out what limits they could accept on the amount of steel they export to the United States, how they would address the issue of excess production of steel and aluminum, and how they would support the U.S. before international bodies like the World Trade Organization.

South Korea made up the largest share of U.S. steel imports last year, shipping about 13 percent of U.S. imports, according to an American Iron and Steel Institute analysis of government data.

In a separate trade battle with China, the United States has threatened to impose tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods in retaliation for what it argues are Beijings unfair trade practices and its requirement that U.S. companies turn over technology in exchange for access to its market.

The White House also wants China to agree to reduce its $375 billion goods trade surplus with the U.S.
