Theresa May says the government will be robust in its response to a House of Lords defeat which potentially gives Parliament a decisive say on Brexit.

The amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill - which would give MPs the power to stop the UK from leaving the EU without a deal, or make Theresa May return to the negotiating table - was approved by 335 votes to 244 on Monday night in the House of Lords.

It was one of three government defeats on the Brexit bill on the one day - bringing the total number of government defeats on the EU bill to nine.
